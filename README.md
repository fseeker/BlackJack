# Running the Game

Open `index.html` in any modern browser and start playing.

# Features
This game has most blackjack rules implemented. The features left out are *split* and *double down*.
Dealer wins all ties, except a blackjack. A **blackjack** scored by the player is an automatic win. Betting has not been implemented. Number of rounds won by the player and dealer are recorded and displayed. The number of cards left in the deck are also displayed. The deck is reshuffled after every 4 rounds, or every time a new game starts.

**This game is best enjoyed on a minimum 6/4 aspect ratio display.**
